# RHCSA Portfolio Project – Enterprise Linux Access Control & Security Hardening Lab

A hands-on, employer-friendly RHCSA-aligned project demonstrating:
- User & group management
- Linux ownership and permissions (chmod/chown/chgrp)
- ACLs (setfacl/getfacl) for fine-grained access
- Special permissions: SUID, SGID, Sticky Bit
- Least-privilege security model + verification

## Scenario (Real-World)
You are a Linux administrator at **AquilaTech Solutions**.  
A shared server hosts sensitive data for multiple departments:
- Engineering
- Finance
- Support  
You must implement access controls to ensure collaboration *without* data leakage.
